# Quick Solution FAQ

### 1. What is OTP SMS and what is its role in information security?
OTP SMS (one-time password) is a technology used to randomly generate a password valid for only one time. This technology is used for several purposes, including password confirmation, order confirmation or payment, securing financial transactions, or confirming user identity verification. OTP is used as an additional security feature, because each time a new password is generated randomly; which prevents the possibility of guessing it for hacking or fraud purpose.

### 2. Why does stc use OTP SMS and when to use it?
stc is keen on protecting the security of its customers' information as one of its anti-fraud initiatives. The company uses OTP SMS to authenticate and approve transactions; in order to secure its customers’ data and to protect them against fraud. stc advises its customers to avoid providing verification codes received through OTP SMS under stc name to anyone via phone call or messages, as verification codes are requested “after the customer receives the service or product” by stc agent only.

### 3. A website says there is a spyware on the computer, is it true?
Please don't believe everything that pops up in your web browser. Those "spyware detected" and similar messages that appear on specific web pages on top of the actual content are ads. Even worse, some of those ads actually install spyware when you click on them, if you have not taken appropriate steps to protect your computer. Unfortunately many websites pay the bills by accepting this sort of completely unethical advertising.

### 4. Are you a FTTH subscriber and facing No Dial Tone Issues?
1. Phone cable may be in the wrong modem port / wall outlet.  
   You should use the Correct Ports / Line Card (Tel1 / Tel 2).
2. Check your modem if it supports FTTH or not, and you should replace it if not supported by the service.
3. Check if you are using an FTTH modem as ADSL modem, i.e once you remove the power you can still receive the dial tone.

2. If there is a problem with the internal wiring, you should connect your phone directly to the modem to isolate the internal wiring and check the services directly. If there is no connection, the problem is then in the internal wiring.

### 10. Do you suffer a poor connection when moving inside your home?
Wireless phones, devices using 2.4 GHz frequencies, house insulations, or large areas can cause a poor connection. Try one of the home Wi-Fi solutions to enhance your home network : https://www.stc.com.sa/content/stc-public-store/sa/en/public-store-landing-page/product-list.html?&categoryId=routers&categoryLabel=4G/5G%20Routers 

### 11. Do you suffer from a lack of Internet connection at all?
1. The default wireless channel you use is Channel 6. Log on to your wireless router and try different channels through your wireless network settings.  
2. If you have a firewall or Internet security software on your computer, try temporarily disabling or uninstalling any Internet security or firewall software. Restart your computer and try to connect again.  
3. If the LAN cable is defective, try changing it if possible.

### 12. Does the Splitter affect Internet connectivity?
Plug the phone directly into the Internet wall outlet. If the problem is solved, it means the splitter is the reason, thus it needs to be replaced.

### 13. FTTH Customers facing No Dial Issues due to wrong modem selection
You are using an FTTH modem as ADSL modem, i.e. once you remove the power, you can still receive the dial tone.  
Check the correct modem type and verify connections.  
After ensuring all these steps, please call 900 for further support.

### 14. If a site shows a message stating I have a spyware on my computer, is it necessarily true?
Please don't believe everything that pops up in your web browser. Messages like "Spyware Detected!" and other similar messages appearing on the top of web pages are just ads.  
Even worse, some of those ads install spyware once you click them, if you do not have the appropriate measures to protect your computer.

### 15. If you are experiencing slow, intermittent, or no internet connection, you can do the following steps to possibly restore your service:
- Ensure the modem is powered on and dial-tone available on the phone.  
- Verify the connection between the computer and the modem. At least one of the green LEDs should be burning.  
- Verify if the ADSL or DSL LNK LED is burning.  
- Verify if the PPP LED is burning.  
- Resynchronize the connection by turning the modem power off for at least 30 seconds before turning the modem on.  
- Ensure no viruses are present on the computer nor spyware and make sure you have up-to-date antivirus and antispyware software installed on your computer. If you discover viruses, take your computer to a qualified technician.  
- Reboot the computer if possible.  
- Your browser might be causing this issue. Try a different browser.  
- Clean your cache in your browser, restore your browser to default settings, and turn off add-ons or extensions (for example, Google Toolbar). If you're using a proxy server, try turning it off.  
- File sharing programs (such as Bit Torrent or The Pirate Bay) can use up your Internet bandwidth, with little leftover for other Internet usage.  
- Game systems (such as Sony PlayStation, Microsoft Xbox, Nintendo Wii) connected to the Internet may be using up most or all of your Internet bandwidth.  
- Make sure that your computer is within the acceptable range of Wi-Fi coverage.  
- Multiple users using the same connection at the same time will impact your browsing speed.  
- Old smartphone models may not have the required speed capability.

### 16. If you have NO Internet at all and are NOT connected wirelessly - CABLE CONNECTIVITY
**A**. Firewall or Internet Security Software on your computer: Try disabling or uninstalling any Internet Security and/or Firewall software temporarily. Reboot your computer and try the connection again.  
**B**. Defective LAN Cable(s): If possible, try switching LAN cables.

### 17. If you have NO Internet at all and are connected wirelessly - WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY
The wireless channel you are using is the default, which is channel 6. Log into your wireless router and try different channels in the wireless settings.
### 18. Internet Connection Keeps Dropping
The LEDs flash on your modem and then suddenly all LEDs light up again.  
If you use splitters, make sure that they are connected properly. If you still experience internet drop, then call 900.

### 19. Is your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) not appearing?
Connect your computer to the router if it is not connected.  
**How to do this from Windows:**  
Go to Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing > Manage Wireless Networks.  
If you find that the wireless network is listed, right-click it and select "Properties," then verify your correct choice, "Connect even if the Service Set Identifier (SSID) is not visible."  
If you can’t find the wireless network listed, click "Add" and select "Manually connect to a wireless network" and type the information for the network you want to connect to.  
Try one of the home Wi-Fi solutions to enhance your home network.

### 20. The Wireless Network's Name/SSID Disappeared
Your SSID or Wi-Fi network name is no longer listed when you click to see available wireless networks. There are various reasons this might happen, and it's not an uncommon occurrence.  
Force your computer to connect to the router even if it's not broadcasting.  
**From Windows:**  
Go to Control Panel | Network and Internet | Network and Sharing | Manage Wireless Networks.  
If you see your wireless network listed, right-click on its icon and click Properties. Check the option "Connect even if the network is not broadcasting its name (SSID)."  
If you don't see your wireless network listed, click "Add" then select "Manually connect to a wireless network" and input your wireless information.  
Try one of our home Wi-Fi solutions to boost the signal inside your house.

### 21. When Moving to Another Room in the House, the Wi-Fi Signal Drops or Wi-Fi Signal is Intermittent
In your first floor or living room, your wireless connection is fine. When you move into another floor or room, the signal becomes weak or nonexistent.  
Cordless phones and any device using the 2.4GHz band could be the cause. Try one of our home Wi-Fi solutions to boost the signal inside your house.

### 22. Why does the web browser suddenly stop working?
1. If your browser starts popping up ads on sites that never use pop-up ads like Google, or if it fails to access certain sites or submit completely different content, there is a high probability that your computer has spyware, which is extremely harmful and violates your privacy.  
2. Don’t accept dialog boxes that ask whether you want to trust software from a company you have never heard of, or a similar message.  
3. Spyware can also sometimes be installed passively, especially if you do not use Windows updates to install all Microsoft fixes for your operating system.

### 23. Why can't games be played on web pages?
If you find that games on the web do not work for you at all (for instance, if you see only a red X in the upper left corner of the area where the game should appear), you probably do not have the Macromedia Flash player correctly installed.
### 24. Why can't games be played on web pages?
If you find that games couldn't be played on web pages at all (for example, if you see a red X in the top-right corner of the screen where the game should appear), it may be because you probably do not have the Macromedia Flash player installed or it's not installed correctly.

### 25. Why is the web browser broken?
If your browser starts popping up ads on sites that never use pop-up ads themselves, such as Google, fails to reach some sites altogether, or sends you to completely different content, there is a good chance your computer is infected by spyware and/or adware. These programs are harmful, invasive of your privacy, and generally awful.  
Don't accept dialog boxes that ask whether you want to trust software from a company you have never heard of, or a similar message. Spyware can also sometimes be installed automatically, especially if you have not used Windows Update to install all Microsoft fixes for your operating system.

### 26. Customer facing no dial tone issues due to internal phone/cable
